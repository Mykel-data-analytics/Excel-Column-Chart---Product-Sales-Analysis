# Excel-Column-Chart---Product-Sales-Analysis
This project uses a column chart in Excel to visualize product performance across total sales. Conditional formatting was applied to highlight products with sales below 1000 in red, making it easier to identify underperforming items.
## Key Insight
Products with sales above 1000 are clearly flagged, helping focus on areas that need improvement.
